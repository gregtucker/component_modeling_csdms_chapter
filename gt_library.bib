	abstract = {Ocean science connects a global community of scientists in many disciplines - physics, chemistry, biology, geology and geophysics. New observational and computational technologies are transforming the ability of scientists to study the global ocean with a more integrated and dynamic approach. This enhanced understanding of the ocean is becoming ever more important in an economically and geopolitically connected world, and contributes vital information to policy and decision makers charged with addressing societal interests in the ocean.\nScience provides the knowledge necessary to realize the benefits and manage the risks of the ocean.  Comprehensive understanding of the global ocean is fundamental to forecasting and managing risks from severe storms, adapting to the impacts of climate change, and managing ocean resources. In the United States, the National Science Foundation (NSF) is the primary funder of the basic research which underlies advances in our understanding of the ocean. Sea Change addresses the strategic investments necessary at NSF to ensure a robust ocean scientific enterprise over the next decade. This survey provides guidance from the ocean sciences community on research and facilities priorities for the coming decade and makes recommendations for funding priorities. },

	abstract = {Amphitheater-headed canyons have been used as diagnostic indicators of erosion by groundwater seepage, which has important implications for landscape evolution on Earth and astrobiology on Mars. Of perhaps any canyon studied, Box Canyon, Idaho, most strongly meets the proposed morphologic criteria for groundwater sapping because it is incised into a basaltic plain with no drainage network upstream, and approximately 10 cubic meters per second of seepage emanates from its vertical headwall. However, sediment transport constraints, 4He and 14C dates, plunge pools, and scoured rock indicate that a megaflood (greater than 220 cubic meters per second) carved the canyon about 45,000 years ago. These results add to a growing recognition of Quaternary catastrophic flooding in the American northwest, and may imply that similar features on Mars also formed by floods rather than seepage erosion.},

@article{Korup:2008yq,
	abstract = {A considerable amount of research has focused on how and when the Tibetan plateau formed in the wake of tectonic convergence between India and Asia. Although far less enquiry has addressed the controls on river incision into the plateau itself, widely accepted theory predicts that steep fluvial knick points (river reaches with very steep gradients) in the eastern Himalayan syntaxis at the southeastern plateau margin should erode rapidly, driving a wave of incision back into the plateau. Preservation of the plateau edge thus presents something of a conundrum that may be resolved by invoking either differential rock uplift matching erosional decay, or other mechanisms for retarding bedrock river incision in this region where high stream power excludes the potential for aridity as a simple limit to dissection of the plateau. Here we report morphologic evidence showing that Quaternary depression of the regional equilibrium line altitude, where long-term glacier mass gain equals mass loss, was sufficient to repeatedly form moraine dams on major rivers: such damming substantially impeded river incision into the southeastern edge of the Tibetan plateau through the coupled effects of upstream impoundment and interglacial aggradation. Such glacial stabilization of the resulting highly focused river incision centred on the Tsangpo gorge could further contribute to initiating and accentuating a locus of rapid exhumation, known as tectonic anaeurysm.},

@article{Bondre:2008aa,
	abstract = {Dinitrogen (N(2)) fixation is widely recognized as an important process in controlling ecosystem responses to global environmental change, both today and in the past; however, significant discrepancies exist between theory and observations of patterns of N(2) fixation across major sectors of the land biosphere. A question remains as to why symbiotic N(2)-fixing plants are more abundant in vast areas of the tropics than in many of the mature forests that seem to be nitrogen-limited in the temperate and boreal zones. Here we present a unifying framework for terrestrial N(2) fixation that can explain the geographic occurrence of N(2) fixers across diverse biomes and at the global scale. By examining trade-offs inherent in plant carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus capture, we find a clear advantage to symbiotic N(2) fixers in phosphorus-limited tropical savannas and lowland tropical forests. The ability of N(2) fixers to invest nitrogen into phosphorus acquisition seems vital to sustained N(2) fixation in phosphorus-limited tropical ecosystems. In contrast, modern-day temperatures seem to constrain N(2) fixation rates and N(2)-fixing species from mature forests in the high latitudes. We propose that an analysis that couples biogeochemical cycling and biophysical mechanisms is sufficient to explain the principal geographical patterns of symbiotic N(2) fixation on land, thus providing a basis for predicting the response of nutrient-limited ecosystems to climate change and increasing atmospheric CO(2).},

@article{anderson1998,
	abstract = {{The rates of many processes that control rock breakdown into
   transportable particles are dependent upon rock temperature. In
   particular, frost-cracking depends largely upon the time spent within a
   range of subzero temperatures I call the frost cracking window. I
   present simple analytic solutions, detailed time series of thermal data
   from a field site, and a numerical model of subsurface temperatures
   that constrain the expected depth dependence of frost cracking.
   Analytic solutions using sinusoidal surface temperature histories
   result in predicted vertical profiles of frost-cracking intensity that
   depend upon the location of the frost-cracking window within the range
   of surface temperatures. In some cases, the expected frost cracking
   intensity decreases monotonically with depth, while in others it
   displays a distinct maximum at depth. I use hourly temperatures
   measured over the I-yr interval April 1995 through March 1996, at 8
   depths up to 42 cm into a granitic bedrock surface in the Laramie
   Range, Wyoming, to constrain an in situ thermal diffusivity of 1.7
   mm(2) s(-1). These temperature histories suggest that frost cracking at
   this site should decrease monotonically with depth into the rock. I
   also use this time series of temperatures to calibrate a numerical
   thermal model in which the top boundary condition is set by a surface
   radiation balance. The data require both a low albedo of the rock
   surface (0.1), and a high atmospheric transmissivity (0.9). I then
   explore the expected near-surface temperatures at other sites by
   running the model with different annual mean temperatures, latitudes,
   and slopes. The resulting simulations suggest that at lower mean annual
   temperatures, as are found in higher latitude and altitude sites, the
   frost cracking maximum should both amplify and deepen into the
   subsurface.}},

	abstract = {{{[} 1] Glacial occupation of alpine valleys results in a distinct
   signature in the long-valley profile, including steepening of the
   profile in the headwaters, flattening at lower elevations, and a step
   in the profile at the convergence of headwater tributaries. We present
   analytic results for glacial erosion patterns by making the following
   assumptions: ( 1) the initial profile is linear, ( 2) the width of the
   valley is uniform, ( 3) the annual mass balance varies linearly with
   elevation, ( 4) the glacier at any time is quasi-steady, ( 5) the
   erosion rate is proportional to ice discharge per unit valley width,
   and ( 6) glacial erosion rates far exceed fluvial erosion rates. A
   steady glacier under these conditions would erode a parabolic divot in
   the longitudinal valley profile, with its maximum depth coinciding with
   the down-valley position of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA). The
   calculated flattening of the valley floor down valley of the ELA and
   the steepening of it up valley captures the essence of the glacial
   signature. When a reasonable probability distribution of ELAs is
   allowed, the predicted erosion peaks at 30 - 40\% of the down-valley
   distance to the glacial limit, and the pattern merges smoothly with the
   steeper fluvial profile downstream of the glacial limit. Profiles of
   mass balance that are capped at a maximum value produce shorter
   glaciers and a slight asymmetry in the expected erosion pattern. Only
   when we mimic the tributaries of glacial headwaters by specifying a
   valley width distribution do we obtain the upper step observed in many
   valley profiles.}},

@article{binnie2007tectonic,
	abstract = {Studies across a broad range of drainage basins have established a positive correlation between mean slope gradient and denudation rates. It has been suggested, however, that this relationship breaks down for catchments where slopes are at their threshold angle of stability because, in such cases, denudation is controlled by the rate of tectonic uplift through the rate of channel incision and frequency of slope failure. This mechanism is evaluated for the San Bernardino Mountains, California, a nascent range that incorporates both threshold hillslopes and remnants of pre-uplift topography. Concentrations of in situ--produced cosmogenic 10Be in alluvial sediments are used to quantify catchment-wide denudation rates and show a broadly linear relationship with mean slope gradient up to ∼30$\,^{\circ}$: above this value denudation rates vary substantially for similar mean slope gradients. We propose that this decoupling in the slope gradient--denudation rate relationship marks the emergence of threshold topography and coincides with the transition from transport-limited to detachment-limited denudation. The survival in the San Bernardino Mountains of surfaces formed prior to uplift provides information on the topographic evolution of the range, in particular the transition from slope-gradient--dependent rates of denudation to a regime where denudation rates are controlled by rates of tectonic uplift. This type of transition may represent a general model for the denudational response to orogenic uplift and topographic evolution during the early stages of mountain building.},

	abstract = {Four to six years of continuous measurements at 10 permanent Global Positioning System sites in the Western Alps show horizontal residual velocities of <2 mm/yr with respect to stable Europe; uncertainties range from 0.3 to 1.4 mm/yr. These velocities and the associated strain-rate field indicate that the central part of the range is currently dominated by east-west extension, whereas the southern part shows north-south to northwest-southeast compression. The geodetic and seismotectonic data are consistent with a model where strain is essentially controlled by the counterclockwise rotation of the Adriatic microplate with respect to Eurasia. This rotation, together with the arcuate shape of the contact between the Adriatic microplate and the Alps, induces dextral shear kinematic boundary conditions across the Western Alps, with an additional divergence component in their central part and in Switzerland, and a convergence component in their southern part.},

@article{Cederbom2004,
	abstract = {Foreland basins record the regional isostatic compensation of mountain belts; during periods of crustal thickening, they subside, and when erosion unloads the mass of the mountains, the basins rebound and are eroded. In order to evaluate this mechanism for rebound, it is critical that the timing and magnitude of erosion are documented. We present data estimating the timing and magnitude of late orogenic or postorogenic erosion in the North Alpine Foreland Basin of Switzerland. Mineral cooling ages demonstrate that the basin underwent 1--3 km of erosion soon after 5 Ma. This erosion coincided with a decline in structural deformation in the Swiss Alps, and a doubling of sediment accumulation rates in surrounding depocenters. We propose that accelerated erosional unroofing of the Swiss Alps triggered isostatic rebound and erosion of the foreland basin after 5 Ma. A projection of the isostatic rebound of the basin into the mountains suggests that at least 6.5 km of erosion should have occurred in the high topography of the Aar Massif. Accelerated erosion in the Swiss Alps at that time is explained by an increase in atmospheric moisture driven by an intensification of the Atlantic Gulf Stream at 4.6 Ma. Consequently, we propose that the changing erosional capacity of the climate triggered late orogenic to postorogenic mass reduction and isostatic rebound of the Swiss Alps and their neighboring foreland basin.},

@article{Champagnac2007,
	abstract = {The high elevation and deep incision of the Alps have traditionally been used as an argument for recent tectonic activity that has elevated the belt and increased erosion rates. Normal faulting and horizontal extension, however, dominate current tectonic activity, and isostatic compensation of thinning crust should lead not to increased but to decreased mean elevations. Here we test the idea that enhanced Quaternary erosion of the Alps and isostatic compensation of the mass removed can account for the distribution of present-day geodetically measured rates of vertical movement in the western Alps. Using geophysical relief and Kuhlemann's estimated average erosion rate for the Alps, we quantify the spatial distribution of erosion and the volume of eroded rock, respectively. From these, we obtain a map of rock eroded within a given time span. The calculated isostatic response of the Alpine lithosphere to erosional unloading for a variety of values of the flexural rigidity of the Alpine lithosphere reaches a maximum of ∼500 m since 1 Ma in the inner Swiss Alps, and vertical movement extends across the entire belt, including peri-Alpine basins. Assuming a steady erosion rate since 1 Ma, this rebound accounts for half of the measured vertical motion of 1.1 mm/yr in the southern Valais. Thus, a significant fraction (∼50%) of the present-day vertical movement results from the isostatic response to enhanced erosion during Plio-Quaternary time.},

@article{Curnelle1982,
	abstract = {The Aquitaine Basin, situated in southwest France, with an area of about 60 000 km$^{2}$, has the form of a triangle which opens towards the Atlantic (Bay of Biscay) and is limited to the north by the Hercynian basement of Brittany and the Massif Central, and to the south by the Pyrenean Tertiary orogenic belt. Beneath the Tertiary sequence (2 km thick, and which outcrops over much of the basin) a Mesozoic series, up to 10 km thick, rests generally on a tectonized Hercynian basement but locally it covers narrow (NW--SE-trending) post-orogenic trenches of Stephano-Permian age. The Mesozoic history can be subdivided into four major structural--sedimentary episodes: (1) during a Triassic taphrogenic phase a continental--evaporitic complex developed with associated basic magmatism; (2) throughout the Jurassic, a vast lagoonal platform developed, initially (Lower Lias) as a thick evaporitic sequence followed by a uniform shale--carbonate unit, indicating a relative structural stability; (3) the end of the Jurassic and the Lower Cretaceous saw a fragmentation of this platform, due to an interplay between the Iberian and European tectonic plates, resulting in an ensemble of strongly subsident sub-basins; (4) during the Upper Cretaceous and until the end of the Neogene, the evolution of the Aquitaine Basin was influenced by the Pyrenean orogenic phase, with the development, towards the south, of a trench infilled by flysch which, from the Upper Eocene, is succeeded by a thick post-orogenic molasse complex. The main hydrocarbon objectives in the basin are situated in the Jurassic platform (e.g. the Lacq giant gas field) and the Cretaceous sub-basins (e.g. the Cazaux and Parentis oil fields).

@article{Glotzbach2011,
	abstract = {A dramatic increase in sediment flux since ca. 5 Ma has been inferred for the European Alps and worldwide, and is interpreted to reflect a climatically driven increase in erosion rates. However, detrital thermochronology data from the Alpine forelands suggest steady Miocene--Pliocene exhumation, contradicting the sediment budget data. We present new detrital apatite fission-track (AFT) data from the foreland of the Western Alps to better resolve Miocene to present-day exhumation rates and to determine sediment provenance. A shift in AFT lag time from <3 m.y. before 13 Ma to ∼6 m.y. from 10 Ma on reflects reorganization of the drainage pattern within the Alps. AFT lag times are constant since then. Thermal modeling reveals that our detrital AFT data set is sufficiently sensitive to detect an increase in erosion rate, but our data record overall steady exhumation of the Western Alps since 10 Ma. Hence, increasing climatically controlled erosion may have been balanced by decreasing tectonic activity since ca. 5 Ma.},

Here we reconstruct the lowering history of the Aare Valley, Switzerland, over the past 4 m.y. by dating cave sediments with cosmogenic 26Al and 10Be. Incision accelerated from ∼120 m/m.y. to ∼1200 m/m.y. at 0.8--1.0 Ma, at least 1 m.y. after the onset of local glaciation. Rapid incision may have been triggered by lowering of the equilibrium line altitude at the mid-Pleistocene climate transition.},

	abstract = {During maximum Pleistocene glacial expansions, the Alpine ice cap invaded the Central Europe uplands and Italian Southalpine foothills. Periglacial basins, such as the Po River Basin, are natural collectors of sediments that record the past biological and climatic changes that involve the waxing and waning of major ice caps. In a 200-m-long core from the central Po Plain, stratigraphic evidence for one such major glacial pulse of the nearby Alpine ice cap is recorded by a sequence boundary, termed the R surface, associated with a drastic reorganization of vegetational, fluvial, and Alpine drainage patterns. The R surface, seismically traceable across the Po Plain subsurface, was constrained magnetostratigraphically to the first prominent Pleistocene glacio-eustatic lowstand of marine isotope stage (MIS) 22 at 0.87 Ma. MIS 22 corresponds to the end of the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution, a marked reorganization of Northern Hemisphere glaciation pattern that took place in the late early Pleistocene. We suggest that the R surface formed at Mid-Pleistocene Revolution--MIS 22 time, during the onset of the first major Pleistocene glaciation in the Alps.},

	abstract = {Numerous empirical and model-based studies argue that, in general, hillslopes and river channels increase their gradients to accommodate high rates of base-level fall. To date, however, few data sets show the dynamic range of both these relationships needed to test theoretical models of hillslope evolution and river incision. Here, we utilize concentrations of 10Be in quartz extracted from river sand on the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau to explore relationships among short-term (102--105 a) erosion rate, hillslope gradient, and channel steepness. Our data illustrate nonlinear behavior and a threshold in the relationship between erosion rate and mean hillslope gradient, confirming the generalization that hillslopes around the world are limited by slope stability and cease to provide a metric for erosion at high rates (>~0.2 mm/a). The relationship between channel steepness index and erosion rate is also nonlinear, but channels continue to steepen beyond the point where threshold hillslopes emerge up to at least 0.6 mm/a, demonstrating that channel steepness is a more reliable topographic metric than mean hillslope gradient for erosion rate and that channels ultimately drive landscape adjustment to increasing rates of base-level fall in tectonically active settings.},

@article{sinclair_ajs2005,
	abstract = {Orogenic asymmetry is ubiquitous in terms of topography, structure and metamorphism, but the relative influences of climate and tectonics in determining such asymmetry remain contentious. This study demonstrates that for the case of the European Pyrenees, orogenic asymmetry is not defined by inherited structural asymmetry, nor by orographic asymmetry of precipitation, but is the simple consequence of the inherent tectonic growth of a doubly-vergent orogen.  The Pyrenees record approximately 60 Myr of upper crustal accretion, erosion and sedimentation that developed from Late Cretaceous to early Miocene times. Approximately 165 km of plate convergence was accommodated by four phases of orogenic growth that can be summarized in terms of their generic orogenic development as follows: 1) Early inversion of passive margin extensional faults, initiating the pro-wedge. 2) Growth by a combination of frontal accretion and underplating to the pro-wedge; symmetrical and steady record of erosion and foreland basin sedimentation. 3) Cessation of pro-wedge frontal accretion with propagation of the retro-wedge deformation front. 4) Accelerated growth of pro-wedge antiformal stack induced by underplating; accelerated erosion over antiformal stack and increase in sediment discharge to pro-foreland basin; stabilization of outer pro-wedge by sediment blanketing.  Discrete element model experiments are used to explore the natural tendency of the system towards asymmetry. Model output demonstrates that during active frontal accretion to the pro-wedge of an orogen, the maxima in erosional denudation is offset towards the pro-wedge relative to the maximum depths of exhumation. This asymmetry is fundamentally driven by the progressive reduction in advection velocities of material within the orogen from the pro-wedge into the retro-wedge. Hence, for an efficient erosional regime, a dynamic coupling between erosion and structural uplift of the pro-wedge will reduce activity of the retro-wedge and hence drive asymmetry in terms of low temperature thermochronometry, erosion and sedimentation. The models also demonstrate the tendency for pro-wedge growth through frontal accretion to slow. However, the cessation of frontal accretion as recorded by the South Pyrenean Thrust Belt (phases 3 and 4) requires additional forcing; it is proposed that the thick wedge-top sedimentation recorded at this time, increased taper angles and hence stabilized the wedge. Accretionary influx into the orogen at this time was accomplished through underplating. These processes governing asymmetry do not require a spatially variable climate or a laterally heterogeneous underthrust plate.

	abstract = {We evaluate spatial and temporal variations in denudation of the north-central Wasatch Mountains, Utah, by determining catchment-wide denudation rates with 10Be concentrations in alluvial sediment and comparing these rates with previously published data on rock uplift and exhumation of the range. Catchments draining the range front show relatively little variation in denudation rate (0.07--0.17 mm/yr), while steeper (mean hillslope gradient >30$\,^{\circ}$) catchments in the core of the range show larger variation (0.17--0.79 mm/yr). We attribute the larger spatial variation in catchment-wide denudation in the core of the range to landsliding of hillslopes at threshold gradients; faster denudation in this region may signify landscape adjustment to late Pleistocene glaciations. The mean denudation rate for all catchments (0.2 mm/yr) is generally consistent with longer-term exhumation rates derived from thermochronometers and with shorter-term vertical fault displacement rates, suggesting that denudation of the north-central Wasatch has been roughly steady, or decreasing slightly, over the past 5 m.y. Although 10Be-based catchment-wide denudation rates are sensitive to localized geomorphic processes and events, overall, they appear to reflect the larger tectonic forces that have driven denudation of the Wasatch Mountains over longer time scales.},

@article{Willett2006,
	abstract = {At the end of the Miocene, the European Alps ceased outward expansion, and tectonic uplift and exhumation shifted into the orogen interior. This shift is consistent with a change from orogenic construction to orogenic destruction, reflecting an increase in the ratio of erosional flux to accretionary flux. The coincidence of this change with an increase in sediment yield from the Alps suggests a climate-driven increase in erosional flux. The timing of deformation and sediment release from the southern Alps indicates that the tectonic change occurred synchronous with the last phase of the Messinian salinity crisis. We attribute the increase in erosional flux to a climatic shift to wetter conditions throughout Europe, likely augmented by the base-level fall that occurred during the Mediterranean dessication. This climate change is represented in the stratigraphic record by the Lago Mare deposits of the Mediterranean salinity crisis.},

   measure long-term rates of chemical weathering and total denudation in
   granitic landscapes in diverse climatic regimes. Our 42 study sites
   encompass widely varying climatic and erosional regimes, with mean
   annual temperatures ranging from 2 to 25 degreesC, average
   precipitation ranging from 22 to 420 cm(.)year(-1), and denudation
   rates ranging from 23 to 755 t(.)km(-2) (.) year(-1). Long-term
   chemical weathering rates range from 0 to 173 t.km(-2) year(-1), in
   several cases exceeding the highest granitic weathering rates on record
   from previous work. Chemical weathering rates are highest at the sites
   with rapid denudation rates, consistent with strong coupling between
   rates of chemical weathering and mineral supply from breakdown of rock.
   A simple empirical relationship based on temperature, precipitation and
   long-term denudation rates explains 89-95\% of the variation in
   long-term weathering rates across our network of sites. Our analysis
   shows that, for a given precipitation and temperature, chemical
   weathering rates increase proportionally with fresh-material supply
   rates. We refer to this as ``supply-limited{''} weathering, in which
   fresh material is chemically depleted to roughly the same degree,
   regardless of its rate of supply from breakdown of rock. The
   temperature sensitivity of chemical weathering rates is two to four
   times smaller than what one would expect from laboratory measurements
   of activation energies for feldspar weathering and previous
   inter-comparisons of catchment mass-balance data from the field. Our
   results suggest that climate change feedbacks between temperature and
   silicate weathering rates may be weaker than previously thought, at
   least in actively eroding, unglaciated terrain similar to our study
   sites. To the extent that chemical weathering rates are supply-limited
   in mountainous landscapes, factors that,regulate rates of mineral
   supply from erosion, such as tectonic uplift, may lead to significant
   fluctuations in global climate over the long term. (C) 2004 Elsevier

	abstract = {{We used cosmogenic nuclide and geochemical mass balance methods to
   measure long-term rates of chemical weathering and physical erosion
   across a steep climatic gradient in the Santa Rosa Mountains, Nevada.
   Our study sites are distributed along a 2 km ridgeline transect that
   spans 2090 to 2750 m in altitude, and encompasses marked contrasts in
   both vegetative cover and snow depth, but is underlain by a single,
   roughly uniform, granodiorite bedrock. Cosmogenic nuclides in colluvial
   soils reveal that denudation rates vary by less than a factor of 1.4
   (104-144 t/km(2)/yr) along this transect. Bulk elemental analyses
   indicate that, relative to the parent rock, soils are less intensively
   weathered with increasing altitude, and show little evidence of
   weathering-related mass losses near the top of the ridge. Chemical
   weathering rates decrease rapidly with increasing altitude, both in
   absolute terms (from 24 to 0 t/km(2)/yr) and as a fraction of total
   denudation rates (from 20 to 0\%). Thus these results indicate an
   increasing dominance of physical erosion with altitude. The observed
   decrease in chemical weathering rates is greater than one would predict
   from the decrease in mean annual temperature using simple weathering
   kinetics, suggesting that weathering rates along our transect may also
   be affected by the progressive decline in vegetative cover and increase
   in snow depth with increasing altitude. These results, considered
   together with weathering rate measurements for a wide range of climates
   in the Sierra Nevada, USA, suggest that chemical weathering rates may
   be particularly sensitive to differences in climate at higher-altitude
   sites. Consistent with this hypothesis, chemical weathering rates fall
   virtually to zero at the highest sites on our transect, suggesting that
   sparsely vegetated, high-altitude crystalline terrain may often be
   characterized by extremely slow silicate weathering rates. (C) 2003

	abstract = {{Quantifying long-term rates of chemical weathering and physical erosion
   is important for understanding the long-term evolution of soils,
   landscapes, and Earth's climate. Here we describe how long-term
   chemical weathering rates can be measured for actively eroding
   landscapes using cosmogenic nuclides together with a geochemical mass
   balance of weathered soil and parent rock. We tested this approach in
   the Rio Icacos watershed, Puerto Rico, where independent studies have
   estimated weathering rates over both short and long timescales. Results
   from the cosmogenic/mass balance method are consistent with three
   independent sets of weathering rate estimates, thus confirming that
   this approach yields realistic measurements of long-term weathering
   rates. This approach can separately quantify weathering rates from
   saprolite and from overlying soil as components of the total. At Rio
   Icacos, nearly 50\% of Si weathering occurs as rock is converted to
   saprolite; in contrast, nearly 100\% of Al weathering occurs in the
   soil. Physical erosion rates are measured as part of our mass balance
   approach, making it particularly useful for studying interrelationships
   between chemical weathering and physical erosion. Our data show that
   chemical weathering rates are tightly coupled with physical erosion
   rates, such that the relationship between climate and chemical
   weathering rates may be obscured by site-to-site differences in the
   rate that minerals are supplied to soil by physical erosion of rock.
   One can normalize for variations in physical erosion rates using the
   ``chemical depletion fraction,{''} which measures the fraction of total
   denudation that is accounted for by chemical weathering. This measure
   of chemical weathering intensity increases with increasing average
   temperature and precipitation in data from climatically diverse
   granitic sites, including tropical Rio Icacos and six temperate sites
   in the Sierra Nevada, California. Hence, across a wide range of climate
   regimes, analysis of chemical depletion fractions appears to
   effectively account for site-to-site differences in physical erosion
   rates, which would otherwise obscure climatic effects on chemical
   weathering rates. Our results show that by quantifying rates of
   physical erosion and chemical weathering together, our mass balance
   approach can be used to determine the relative importance of climatic
   and nonclimatic factors in regulating long-term chemical weathering
   rates. Copyright (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.}},

   grains near the earth's surface, and thus can be used to measure
   whole-catchment erosion rates averaged over millennial time scales.
   Quartz is enriched in hillslope regolith by the dissolution of more
   soluble minerals; thus, its residence time will be longer than the
   regolith average. It has been noted that this introduces a bias into
   erosion rate estimates derived from cosmogenic nuclide concentrations
   in regolith or alluvium {[}Geomorphology 27 (1999) 131], but the
   magnitude of this bias has not previously been measured. The enrichment
   of quartz in regolith, and the resulting bias in cosmogenic erosion
   rate estimates, can be quantified using concentrations of immobile

   weathering have remained uncertain, because long-term chemical
   weathering rates have been difficult to measure. Here we show that
   long-term chemical weathering rates can be measured by combining
   physical erosion rates, inferred from cosmogenic nuclides, with
   dissolution losses, inferred from the rock-to-soil enrichment of
   insoluble elements, We used this method to measure chemical weathering
   rates across 22 mountainous granitic catchments that span a wide range
   of erosion rates and climates, Chemical weathering rates correlate
   strongly with physical erosion rates but only weakly with climate,
   implying that, by regulating erosion rates, tectonic uplift may

	abstract = {{Rates of sediment supply by landsliding to an alluvial channel in a
   small catchment in central Switzerland were estimated over an 11-month
   study period. Fluvial sediment transport in the channel is
   independently monitored at the upstream and downstream ends of the
   study reach, yielding a unique opportunity to quantitatively compare
   the volume of sediment supplied to the channel with the volume in
   fluvial transport. Landslide-derived sediment discharge to the channel
   was greatest during the winter and spring months, while most of the
   fluvial sediment transport occurred during short, intense summer
   storms. Approximately 98m(3) of sediment was delivered directly to the
   study reach by landsliding, similar to 80m(3) was transported into the
   reach from upstream, and similar to 70m(3) was transported out of the
   reach. Thus, there was a net accumulation of similar to 100m(3) of
   sediment during the 11-month study. Decadal-scale channel aggradation
   was independently assessed by comparing channel longitudinal profiles
   in 1993 and 2004. During this 11-year period, a total of similar to
   1500m(3) of sediment has accumulated in the study reach. Aggradation
   has occurred largely in two broad zones that correspond with both the
   locations of major landslide complexes and reaches of high channel
   slope, indicating that hillslope sediment input left an imprint on the
   morphology of the channel bed that appears to be stable over at least
   decadal time scales. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

	abstract = {Modeling in geomorphology, as in other geophysical sciences, is now pervasive. Although research papers effectively disseminate information about individual models, there are few formal outlets for discussing the broader aspects and objectives of modeling in the Earth sciences. Prediction in Geomorphology addresses these issues:

\# What do we model and why?
\# What are the advantages of different approaches?
\# How do we evaluate whether a model is correct or useful?

These issues are relevant to modeling in any geophysical science. This book will appeal to scientists and researchers engaged in modeling the Earth's surface, particularly in geomorphology, hydrology and ecology, which share similar challenges regarding scale; application to social needs; and the contingent nature of Earth surface processes.

@article{zhang2007late,
	abstract = {{{[}1] Both Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements and studies of
   Late Quaternary faulting are consistent with a slip rate of similar to
   10 mm/yr along the central segment of the Altyn Tagh Fault and a
   systematic decrease in that rate toward the eastern end of the fault.
   Dates of terraces above and below laterally offset terrace risers yield
   bounds on Quaternary slip rates that range from those that agree with
   GPS measurements to values as much as three times faster. We argue that
   offset terrace risers that are protected by topography upstream of them
   are more closely dated by the age of the upper terrace than by that of
   the lower terrace. In some cases, valleys upstream of the fault have
   been incised into bedrock, and few if any terrace risers can be seen
   within the valleys. Such streams debouch onto alluviated floodplains or
   fans that become incised, presumably during climate changes, to create
   terrace risers. The terrace risers are then displaced so that they lie
   downslope from bedrock ridges on the upstream side of the fault, and
   thus the risers become protected from further incision. In such cases,
   dates of upper terraces should more closely approximate the ages of the
   risers than those of lower terraces. Such dates yield slip rates of
   similar to 10 mm/yr in the central segment of the fault and decreasing
   rates eastward. Although we cannot with certainty rule out the higher
   slip rates along the Altyn Tagh Fault, our analysis does show that
   viable interpretations consistent with GPS measurements are more
   likely, at least along some segments of the fault. Not only do these
   rates support the view that the Tibetan Plateau deforms internally by
   slip on a distributed network of faults in the shallow brittle crust,
   and hence behaves as a continuum at depth, but the gradual decrease
   toward the east also shows that the Altyn Tagh Fault does not separate
   two effectively rigid lithospheric plates. Correspondingly, the
   relatively low slip rate and the eastward decrease in slip rate suggest
   that the Altyn Tagh Fault does not transfer a significant portion of
   the convergence between India and Asia into northeastward extrusion of
   the Tibetan Plateau. Thus, large-scale extrusion of crustal material in
   India's path into Eurasia seems to be limited largely to the confines
   of the Tibetan Plateau.}},

   The timescale for static fatigue decreases exponentially with
   differential stress. By creating deeper, steeper valleys, incision
   should increase the differential stress and, as a result, accelerate
   fracturing of intact rock. Because both fluvial systems and hillslopes
   can transport fractured rock much more easily than they can both erode
   intact rock and then transport its products, topographically induced
   fracturing could play a crucial role in landscape evolution, especially
   of steep terrain. Predicting differential stress useful for general
   rules in geomorphology, however, appears to be difficult, in part
   because the stress distribution depends sensitively on the precise form
   of the topography and, perhaps more importantly, because the
   differential stress for specific topography can differ not only in
   magnitude but also in sign for small differences in Poisson's ratio.
   Nevertheless, it appears possible that in steep terrain where rivers
   are capable of moving bed load sufficiently rapidly, the rate-limiting
   process for incision might be static fatigue of the rock under stress

   climates show that frequency of occurrence relationships for the
   large-discharge tails of both follow power laws. The number N(Q) of
   days on which the discharge exceeds Q, or the number of years in which
   the peak discharge exceeds Q, is related to Q by N(Q) proportional to
   Q(-alpha). Values of the exponent alpha (1<alpha<6) decrease in
   magnitude with increasing aridity so that the ratio of the frequency of
   occurrence of very large discharges to that of smaller discharges is
   higher in arid than in humid environments of the United States. To
   examine the effect of climate change on bed load transport and river
   incision, we obtain a curve-fit relating mean annual discharge per unit
   area of drainage basin (an effective precipitation rate (P) over bar)
   to alpha:alpha-1 proportional to (P) over bar (n), where n approximate
   to 1.6. Using this relationship, we confirm that rivers in arid regions
   should incise less rapidly as climate becomes yet more arid. (If no
   water flows, the ``river'' transports no sediment.) Whether
   aridification of an initially humid environment leads to increased or
   decreased incision rates, however, depends on the minimum (threshold)
   discharge capable not only of transporting bed load but also sufficient
   to scour alluvium from the riverbed and then erode the bedrock. The
   curve fit relating (P) over bar to alpha implies that for aridification
   to accelerate incision, floods that recur only once or twice per
   millennium (or less frequently) must carry out most of the incision. An
   overestimate of n could permit smaller, more frequent floods to incise,

   The common denominator of such evidence is the approximate simultaneity
   of that closing with global cooling and the first major ice advance. At
   the resolution of paleoclimate, however, geologic evidence from Central
   America places only weak constraints on when interchange between
   Pacific and Caribbean water ceased. The strongest evidence for when
   North and South America became connected by a continuous land bridge,
   the ``Great American Exchange'' of vertebrates, assigns climate change
   the causal role, for an arid Central American climate, typical of
   glacial times, seems necessary for animals that inhabited savannas to
   pass through Panama. Paleoceanographic and geochemical studies of
   environments and water masses in the eastern Pacific, western
   Caribbean, and Atlantic in general call for continual change since
   similar to 6 Ma or earlier, if evidence concurrent with global change
   near 3.5 - 3 Ma seems more widespread than for other times.
   Hypothesized connections between a closed seaway and glaciation

   western Pacific Ocean show that sea-surface temperatures, and
   apparently also the depth and temperature distribution in the
   thermocline, have changed markedly over the past similar to 4m.y., from
   those resembling an E1 Nino state before ice sheets formed in the
   Northern Hemisphere to the present-day marked contrast between the
   eastern and western tropical Pacific. In addition, differences between
   late Miocene to early Pliocene (pre-Ice Age) paleoclimates and
   present-day average climates, particularly in the Western Hemisphere,
   resemble those associated with teleconnections from E1 Nino events,
   consistent with the image of a permanent E1 Nino state. Agreement is
   imperfect in that many differences between early Pliocene and
   present-day climates of parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia do not
   resemble the anomalies associated with canonical E1 Nino
   teleconnections. The teleconnections associated with the largest E1
   Nino event in the past 100 yr, that in 1997-1998, do, however, reveal
   similar patterns of warming and the same sense, if not magnitude, of
   precipitation anomalies shown by differences between late Miocene-early
   Pliocene paleoclimates and present-day mean climates in these regions.
   If less consistent than those for the 1997-1998 event, temperature and
   precipitation anomalies correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
   also mimic many differences between early Pliocene and present-day
   climates. These similarities suggest that the sea-surface temperature
   distribution in the Pacific Ocean before Ice Age time resembled most
   that of the 1997-1998 E1 Nino, with the warmest region extending into
   the easternmost Pacific Ocean, not near the dateline as occurs in most
   E1 Nino events. This inference is consistent with equatorial Pacific
   proxy data indicating that at most a small east-west gradient in
   sea-surface temperature seems to have existed along the equator in late
   Miocene to early Pliocene time. Accordingly, such a difference in
   sea-surface temperatures may account for the large global differences

   deformation of the upper crust. At least some aftershocks must nucleate
   or lengthen cracks, which contribute to the comminution of these rock
   masses. Scaling rules suggest that dimensions of ruptures for very
   small (M < -2) earthquakes can be meters or less. The Gutenberg-Richter
   recurrence relationship implies that such earthquakes are common, as
   high-magnification seismographs in low-noise environments confirm.
   Moreover, large differences among fault plane solutions for aftershocks
   show that the small faults on which they occur are not parallel to one
   another; some faults must intersect. Thus the upper crust in
   tectonically active regions should be fragmented into blocks down to
   the scale of boulders or smaller. Dismembered rock arrives at the
   Earth's surface already prepared to be transported away. As a
   corollary, both deeply exhumed lower crust and posttectonic igneous
   rock, never deformed under brittle conditions and not deformed
   recently, should be less susceptible to detachment and subsequent
   transport than fractured rock.}},

   investigated for rivers having a wide range of discharge (five orders
   of magnitude). The variables, water-surface width and average depth,

   links (river reaches between major tributaries). These measurements
   provide data to characterize the two-dimensional structure of a channel
   link which is the fundamental unit of a channel network.
   The morphological variables have nearly log-normal probability
   distributions. A general relation was determined which relates the
   means of the log-transformed variables to the logarithm of discharge
   similar to previously published downstream hydraulic geometry
   relations. The spatial variability of the variables is described by two
   properties: (1) the coefficient of variation which was nearly constant
   (0.13-0.42) over a wide range of discharge; and (2) the integral length
   scale in the downstream direction which was approximately equal to one
   to two mean channel widths. The joint probability distribution of the
   morphological variables in the downstream direction was modelled as a
   first-order, bivariate autoregressive process. This model accounted for
   up to 76 per cent of the total variance. The two-dimensional

   valuable to modellers of both basin and channel dynamics. Published in

	abstract = {{A wildfire in May 1996 burned 4690 hectares in two watersheds forested
   by ponderosa pine and Douglas fir in a steep, mountainous landscape
   with a summer, convective thunderstorm precipitation regime. The
   wildfire lowered the erosion threshold in the watersheds, and
   consequently amplified the subsequent erosional response to shorter
   time interval episodic rainfall and created both erosional and
   depositional features in a complex pattern throughout the watersheds.
   The initial response during the first four years was an increase in
   runoff and erosion rates followed by decreases toward pre-fire rates.
   The maximum unit-area peak discharge was 24 m(3) s(-1) km(-2) for a
   rainstorm in 1996 with a rain intensity of 90 min h(-1). Recovery to
   pre-fire conditions seems to have occurred by 2000 because for a
   maximum 30-min rainfall intensity of 50 mm. h(-1), the unit-area peak
   discharge in 1997 was 6.6 m(3) s(-1) km(-2), while in 2000 a similar
   intensity produced only 0.11 m(3) s(-1) km(-2). Rill erosion accounted
   for 6 per cent, interrill erosion for 14 per cent, and drainage erosion
   for 80 per cent of the initial erosion in 1996. This represents about a
   200-fold increase in erosion rates on hillslopes which had a recovery
   or relaxation time of about three years. About 67 per cent of the
   initially eroded sediment is still stored in the watersheds after four
   years with an estimated residence time greater than 300 years. This
   residence time is much greater than the fire recurrence interval so
   erosional and depositional features may become legacies from the
   wildfire and may affect landscape evolution by acting as a new set of
   initial conditions for subsequent wildfire and flood sequences.

	abstract = {{Flood processes no longer actively increase the planform area of
   terraces. Instead, lateral erosion decreases the area. However,
   infrequent extreme floods continue episodic aggradation of terraces
   surfaces. We quantify this type of evolution of terraces by an extreme
   flood in May 1978 on Powder River in southeastern Montana. Within an
   89-km study reach of the river, we (1) determine a sediment budget for
   each geomorphic feature, (2) interpret the stratigraphy of the newly
   deposited sediment, and (3) discuss the essential role of vegetation in
   the depositional processes.
   Peak flood discharge was about 930 in S, which lasted about eight days.
   During this time, the flood transported 8.2 million tons of sediment
   into and 4.5 million tons out of the study reach. The masses of
   sediment transferred between features or eroded from one feature and
   redeposited on the same feature exceeded the mass transported out of
   the reach. The flood inundated the floodplain and some of the remnants
   of two terraces along the river. Lateral erosion decreased the planform
   area of the lower of the two terraces (similar to 2.7 in above the
   riverbed) by 3.2\% and that of the higher terrace (similar to 3.5 in
   above the riverbed) by 4.1\%. However, overbank aggradation, on
   average, raised the lower terrace by 0.16 in and the higher terrace by
   0.063 m.
   Vegetation controlled the type, thickness, and stratigraphy of the
   aggradation on terrace surfaces. Two characteristic overbank deposits
   were common: coarsening-upward sequences and lee dunes. Grass caused
   the deposition of the coarsening-upward sequences, which had 0.02 to
   0.07 m of mud at the base, and in some cases, the deposits coarsened
   upwards to coarse sand on the top. Lee dunes, composed of fine and very
   fine sand, were deposited in the wake zone downstream from the trees.
   The characteristic morphology of the dunes can be used to estimate some
   flood variables such as suspended-sediment particle size, minimum
   depth, and critical shear velocity. Information about depositional
   processes during extreme floods is rare, and therefore, the results
   from this study aid in interpreting the record of terrace stratigraphy

   However, a quantitative relation between the runoff response and burn
   severity at the watershed scale has not been established. Runoff
   response was measured as the runoff coefficient C, which is equal to
   the peak discharge per unit drainage area divided by the average
   maximum 30 min rainfall intensity during each rain storm. The magnitude
   of the burn severity was expressed as the change in the normalized burn
   ratio. A new burn severity variable, hydraulic functional connectivity
   Phi was developed and incorporates both the magnitude of the burn
   severity and the spatial sequence of the burn severity along hillslope
   flow paths. The runoff response and the burn severity were measured in
   seven subwatersheds (0.24 to 0.85 km(2)) in the upper part of Rendija
   Canyon burned by the 2000 Cerro Grande Fire near Los Alamos, New
   Mexico, USA.
   A rainfall-discharge relation was determined for four of the
   subwatersheds with nearly the same burn severity. The peak discharge
   per unit drainage area Q(u)(peak) was a linear function of the maximum
   30 min rainfall intensity I-30. This function predicted a rainfall
   intensity threshold of 8.5 mm h(-1) below which no runoff was
   generated. The runoff coefficient C = Q(u)(peak)/I-30 was a linear
   function of the mean hydraulic functional connectivity of the
   subwatersheds. Moreover, the variability of the mean hydraulic
   functional connectivity was related to the variability of the mean
   runoff coefficient, and this relation provides physical insight into
   why the runoff response from the same subwatershed can vary for
   different rainstorms with the same rainfall intensity. Published in

   faults in the North Baikal Rift (NBR), eastern Siberia, based on a
   statistical analysis of triangular faceted scarps. Fault-bounded ridges
   in the NBR display typical morphologies with several contiguous facets
   separated by fault-perpendicular catchments. Over a range of 20 fault
   segments analyzed, triangular facet heights vary from similar to 200 to
   >900 m. As fault scarps have been developing under similar long-term
   climatic conditions, we infer that the scatter in mean facet height
   arises from long-term differences in fault throw rate. We compare the
   morphology of NBR facets with results obtained in a previously
   published numerical model of facet growth. Using facet height as an
   input, model results provide estimates of the long-term fault throw
   rate. NBR throw rates vary between 0.2 and 1.2 mm yr(-1). The throw
   rates are then compared with the cumulated throw, which has been
   constrained by geophysical and stratigraphic data in the basins. This
   provides an estimate of the age of fault and basin initiation. We show
   that the modern stage of basin development started circa 3 Myr ago,

	abstract = {{We present a combined surface processes and tectonic model which allows
   us to determine the climatic and tectonic parameters that control the
   development of faceted spurs at normal fault scarps. Sensitivity tests
   to climatic parameter values are performed. For a given precipitation
   rate, when hillslope diffusion is high and channel bedrock is highly
   resistant to erosion, the scarp is smooth and undissected. When,
   instead, the bedrock is easily eroded and diffusion is limited,
   numerous channels develop and the scarp becomes deeply incised. Between
   these two end-member states, diffusion and incision compete to produce
   a range of scarp morphologies, including faceted spurs. The sensitivity
   tests allow us to determine a dimensionless ratio of erosion, f, for
   which faceted spurs can develop. This study evidences a strong
   dependence of facet slope angle on throw rate for throw rates between
   0.4 and 0.7 mm/a. Facet height is also shown to be a linear function of
   fault throw rate. Model performance is tested on the Wasatch Fault,
   Utah, using topographic, geologic, and seismologic data. A Monte Carlo
   inversion on the topography of a portion of the Weber segment shows
   that the 5 Ma long development of this scarp has been dominated by a
   low effective precipitation rate (similar to 1.1 m/a) and a moderate
   diffusion coefficient (0.13 m(2)/a). Results demonstrate the ability of
   our model to estimate normal fault throw rates from the height of
   triangular facets and to retrieve the average long-term diffusion and
   incision parameters that prevailed during scarp evolution using an
   accurate 2-D misfit criterion.}},

	abstract = {{Centimeter-scale measurements on several Powder River floodplains
   provide insights into the nature of overbank depositional processes
   that created the floodplains during a 20-year period after a major
   flood in 1978. Rising stages initially entered across a sill at the
   downriver end of the floodplains. Later, as stages continued to rise,
   water entered the floodplains through distinct low saddles along
   natural levees. The annual maximum depth of water over the levee crest
   averaged 0.19 m from 1983 through 1996, and the estimated flow
   velocities were approximately 0.15 m s(-1). Water ponded in the
   floodplain trough, a topographic low between the natural levee and the
   pre-flood riverbank, and mud settled as thin layers of nearly constant
   thickness. Mud layers alternated with sand layers, which were
   relatively thick near the channel. Together, these beds created a
   distinctive natural levee. In some locations, individual flood deposits
   began as a thin mud layer that gradually coarsened upwards to
   medium-grained sand. Coarsening-upwards sequences form initially as mud
   because only the uppermost layers of water in the channel supply the
   first overbank flows, which are rich in mud but starved of sand. At
   successively higher stages, fine sands and then medium sands increase
   in concentration in the floodwater and are deposited as fine- and
   medium-sand layers overlying the initial mud layer. Theoretical
   predictions from mathematical models of sediment transport by advection
   and diffusion indicate that these processes acting alone are unlikely
   to create the observed sand layers of nearly uniform thickness that
   extend across much of the floodplain. We infer that other transport
   processes, notably bedload transport, must be important along Powder
   River. Even with the centimeter-scale measurements of floodplain
   deposits, daily hydraulic data, and precise annual surface topographic
   surveys, we were unable to determine any clear correspondence between
   the gauged flow record of overbank floods and the depositional layers
   mapped in the floodplain. These results provide a detailed example of
   floodplain deposits and depositional processes that should prove useful
   for interpreting natural levee deposits in a variety of geologic
   settings.}},

	abstract = {{The drainage networks of catchment areas burned by wildfire were
   analysed at several scales. The smallest scale (1-1000 m(2))
   representative of hillslopes, and the small scale (1000,112 to 1
   km(2)), representative of small catchments, were characterized by the
   analysis of field measurements. The large scale (1-1000 km(2))
   representative of perennial stream networks, was derived from a 30-m
   digital elevation model and analysed by computer analysis. Scaling laws
   used to describe large-scale drainage networks could be extrapolated to
   the small scale but could not describe the smallest scale of drainage
   structures observed in the hillslope region. The hillslope drainage
   network appears to have a second-order effect that reduces the number
   of order I and order 2 streams predicted by, the large-scale channel
   structure. This network comprises two spatial patterns of rills with
   width-to-depth ratios typically less than 10. One pattern is parallel
   rills draining nearly planar hillslope surfaces, and the other pattern
   is three to six converging rills draining the critical source area
   uphill from an order I channel head. The magnitude of this critical
   area depends on infiltration, hillslope roughness and critical shear
   stress for erosion of sediment, all of which can be substantially
   altered by wildfire. Order I and 2 streams were found to constitute the
   interface region, which is altered by a disturbance, like wildfire,
   from subtle unchannelized drainages in unburned catchments to incised
   drainages. These drainages are characterized by gullies also with
   width-to-depth ratios typically less than 10 in burned catchments. The
   regions (hillslope, interface and channel) had different drainage
   network structures to collect and transfer water and sediment.

@article{moody2005,
	abstract = {{{[}1] Increased erosion is a well- known response after wildfire. To
   predict and to model erosion on a landscape scale requires knowledge of
   the critical shear stress for the initiation of motion of soil
   particles. As this soil property is temperature- dependent, a
   quantitative relation between critical shear stress and the
   temperatures to which the soils have been subjected during a wildfire
   is required. In this study the critical shear stress was measured in a
   recirculating flume using samples of forest soil exposed to different
   temperatures ( 40degrees- 550degreesC) for 1 hour. Results were
   obtained for four replicates of soils derived from three different
   types of parent material ( granitic bedrock, sandstone, and volcanic
   tuffs). In general, the relation between critical shear stress and
   temperature can be separated into three different temperature ranges (<
   175\&DEG;C; 175\&DEG;C - 275\&DEG;C; > 275degreesC), which are similar
   to those for water repellency and temperature. The critical shear
   stress was most variable ( 1.0 - 2.0 N m(-2)) for temperatures <
   175\&DEG;C, was a maximum (> 2.0 N m(-2)) between 175degrees and
   275degreesC, and was essentially constant ( 0.5 - 0.8 N m(-2)) for
   temperatures > 275degreesC. The changes in critical shear stress with
   temperature were found to be essentially independent of soil type and
   suggest that erosion processes in burned watersheds can be modeled more
   simply than erosion processes in unburned watersheds. Wildfire reduces
   the spatial variability of soil erodibility associated with unburned
   watersheds by eliminating the complex effects of vegetation in
   protecting soils and by reducing the range of cohesion associated with
   different types of unburned soils. Our results indicate that modeling
   the erosional response after a wildfire depends primarily on
   determining the spatial distribution of the maximum soil temperatures
   that were reached during the wildfire.}},

	abstract = {{Understanding the evolution of geochemical and geomorphic systems
   requires measurements of long-term rates of physical erosion and
   chemical weathering. Erosion and weathering rates have traditionally
   been estimated from measurements of sediment and solute fluxes in
   streams. However, modem sediment and solute fluxes are often decoupled
   from long-term rates of erosion and weathering, due to storage or
   re-mobilization of sediment and solutes upstream from the sampling
   point. Recently, cosmogenic nuclides such as Be-10 and Al-26 have
   become important new tools for measuring long-term rates of physical
   erosion and chemical weathering. Cosmogenic nuclides can be used to
   infer the total denudation flux (the sum of the rates of physical
   erosion and chemical weathering) in actively eroding terrain. Here we
   review recent work showing how this total denudation flux can be
   partitioned into its physical and chemical components, using the
   enrichment of insoluble tracers (such as Zr) in regolith relative to
   parent rock. By combining cosmogenic nuclide measurements with the bulk
   elemental composition of rock and soil, geochemists can measure rates
   of physical erosion and chemical weathering over 1000- to 10,000-year
   time scales. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   scales at 32 Idaho mountain catchments, ranging from small experimental
   watersheds (0.2 km(2)) to large river basins (35 000 km(2)), These
   long-term sediment yields are, on average, 17 times higher than stream
   sediment fluxes measured over 10-84 yr, but are consistent with 10 m.y.
   erosion rates measured by apatite fission tracks. Our results imply
   that conventional sediment-yield measurements - even those made over
   decades - can greatly underestimate long-term average rates of sediment
   delivery and thus overestimate the life spans of engineered reservoirs.
   Our observations also suggest that sediment delivery from mountainous
   terrain is extremely episodic, sporadically subjecting mountain stream
   ecosystems to extensive disturbance.}},

@article{harig2008rayleigh,
	abstract = {{The separation of zones of apparent downwelling flow at the ends of the
   Sierra Nevada suggests a relatively large wavelength (similar to 500
   km) of unstable growth, but Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities for plausible
   rheological structures with a fixed top boundary condition require much
   shorter wavelengths (< 100 km) for maximum growth rates. To understand
   this difference, we analyze analytical solutions and perform numerical
   2-D plane strain experiments for Rayleigh-Taylor instability of a dense
   layer overlying a less dense substratum, representing the instability
   between the mantle lithosphere and the underlying asthenosphere,
   focusing on the effects of a shear stress free boundary condition at
   the top. The overall effect of this condition is an enhancement of
   growth rate factors at long wavelengths, which depends greatly on the
   exponential viscosity variation with depth of the layer. With large or
   little variation across the unstable layer, the solutions approximate
   those with a fixed top boundary condition or for constant viscosity,
   respectively. An intermediate zone showing the enhanced growth rates
   includes ratios of layer thickness to viscosity e-folding length, h/L,
   of similar to 1 - 8 for Newtonian viscosity and similar to 1 - 4 for
   nonlinear viscosity. The free top condition is likely applicable to
   geologic situations where the lower crust is weak. Olivine flow laws
   and low-temperature estimates at 35 km depth (255 - 355 degrees C)
   place the Sierra Nevada viscosity scaling ratio, h/L, between 5 and 9.
   Thus longer wavelengths than commonly assumed for Rayleigh-Taylor
   instabilities seem permissible when viscosity decreases with depth and
   the top surface of the layer is only weakly constrained. Citation:

@article{ellis1999,
	abstract = {{We use the landscape evolution model Zscape to explore quantitatively
   the development of mountainous topography in the Basin and Range
   province (formerly the Basin Ranges), USA, as a function of faulting,
   surface processes and microclimate. Many of the classic morphologies of
   mountains in the Basin and Range were described in the late part of the
   19th century. The varied topography coupled with differing experiences
   led to a similarly diverse set of explanations. We are able to
   demonstrate through a variety of numerical experiments that a diverse
   landscape is easily obtained by the simple, steady combination of
   tectonic and surface processes. Numerical landscapes reveal the same
   features observed in the field, including facets, spur benches,
   piedmonts, and relatively linear and regularly spaced drainages. In all
   cases, a steady-state landscape is generated on the order of 10(6)
   years, so that there remains little information in the landscape that
   can tell us about processes or conditions prior to 1 million years ago.
   The fundamental form of the steady-state landscape (including the facet
   and spur bench morphology) is governed by the spacing of rivers and
   bedrock strength and the resulting relief is for the most part
   strength-limited. Neither hillslope nor facet relief is dependent on
   the rate of fault slip or channel incision. Relief is incision-limited,
   however, nearer the headwaters of rivers where stream power is
   relatively low. Topographically asymmetric ranges may be generated over
   tectonically symmetric horsts by allowing precipitation to be driven by
   orographic processes, but the asymmetry is likely to be dependent on
   the ability to remove eroded material from the adjacent basins. The
   value of the experiments presented here is to demonstrate that the
   astute and impressive observations made by the likes of Gilbert, Davis
   and Dutton are reproducible using a relatively simple description of
   the relevant physics and that we can recognize and explain various
   landscape morphologies that have in the past been the subject of
   necessarily qualtitative reasoning.}},
